                    <p>Canterbury Christ Church University</p>
                    <p>My doctoral research focuses on the impact of creative dance on early childhood development. I am exploring how movement and artistic expression can enhance cognitive, creative, and social growth in children. This research aims to integrate performing arts into educational frameworks to support holistic development.</p>

                    <p>Canterbury Christ Church University</p>
                    <p>During my master’s studies, I gained extensive knowledge in managing arts and cultural projects, with a focus on dance and curating. My thesis, “Street Dance: A Reflection of Gender Equality & Stereotypes,” explored how street dance challenges gender norms, focusing on Cyprus. I also enhanced my curatorial skills through museum visits and exhibitions, deepening my understanding of dance as a tool for social commentary and community engagement.</p>

                    <p>My undergraduate studies provided a strong foundation in various forms of dance and performance. I focused on the practical and theoretical aspects of dance, developing my skills in choreography and performance. My final project involved creating and performing a dance piece that explored themes of identity and self-expression.</p>
